# Flatmates_Bill
The purpose of this program is to split the bill of flatmates in an honest way. It takes the days person 1 has been at home for a particular period (let's say 25 days) and the same with person 2 (let's say 19 days) and the total bill. It then calculates with a formula how much each person has to pay based on the days they've spent at the house, and generates a nice PDF of all this information. This project is a part of my OOP (Object-Oriented-Programming)
