Title = Flatmates bill

Discribtion: An app that gets as input the amount of a bill for a particular period and 
             the days that each flatmate stayed in the house for that period and returns
             how much each flatmate should pay. It also generates a pdf report stating 
             the names of the flatmates, the period and how much each of them had to pay

All nouns of the discription: app, amount, bill, period, days, flatmate, house, pdf

Now think of the objects that we really need to make a class of

object 1: bill

now think of possible attributes of bill out of the discription
